# Random-Forest

This repository contains an implementation of the Random Forest algorithm using Python and popular machine learning libraries. The project is designed to demonstrate how ensemble learning can improve classification performance on real-world datasets.

## 📌 Project Overview

Random Forest is a powerful ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to achieve better accuracy and robustness. In this project, I have built and evaluated a Random Forest classifier using essential Python libraries such as:

- **NumPy** – for numerical computations  
- **pandas** – for data manipulation  
- **Matplotlib** – for data visualization  
- **scikit-learn (sklearn)** – for building and evaluating the Random Forest model  

## 🛠️ Features

- Data loading and preprocessing  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualization using Matplotlib  
- Feature engineering and selection  
- Training and evaluation of the Random Forest classifier  
- Visualization of data distributions and model results  
- ✅ **Deployable for real-time predictions**

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python 3.7 or higher installed. Install the required packages with:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn


This project is structured to be deployable for real-world applications. The trained Random Forest model can be integrated into web services using:

Flask or FastAPI for building APIs

Docker for containerization
